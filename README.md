# Database-System

NinerEats is a “campus-wide” food delivery service. The application lets people explore restaurant menus, order and get the food delivered at designated locations like dorms, student union, etc. across the campus. It is similar to uber eats and doordash but the scope of delivery is limited to the university campus area to ensure added security precautions. Also, only people related to the University as students, faculty, etc. can use the application. We have identified three main actors in the use case:
1.       Customer: Explores the menu and places the order.
2.       Driver: Picks the food from the restaurant and delivers the order to the designated location.
3.       Admin: Maintains and monitors the database.

Scope:

The scope of this project is divided into three main categories which are database, backend, and UI. The database is an extensive and complete MySQL database with high-level views, stored procs, and triggers. The backend act as a broker between the UI and the database with minimal business logic. The UI is web-based providing the basic CRUD operations.
